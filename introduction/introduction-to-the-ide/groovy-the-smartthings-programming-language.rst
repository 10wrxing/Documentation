Groovy – The SmartThings Programming Language
=============================================

The SmartApp programming language is a Domain Specific Language based on
the Groovy programming language.

Groovy is an
`object-oriented <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming>`__
`programming
language <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language>`__ for the
`Java platform <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_platform>`__. It is a
`dynamic
language <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming_language>`__
with features similar to those of
`Python <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29>`__,
`Ruby <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_%28programming_language%29>`__,
`Perl <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl>`__, and
`Smalltalk <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk>`__. It can be used
as a `scripting
language <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripting_language>`__ for the
Java Platform, is dynamically compiled to `Java Virtual
Machine <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Virtual_Machine>`__ (JVM)
`bytecode <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bytecode>`__, and interoperates
with other Java code and
`libraries <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_%28computer_science%29>`__.
Groovy uses a Java-like `bracket
syntax <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curly_bracket_programming_language>`__.
Most Java code is also syntactically valid Groovy.

By basing our first programming language on Groovy, we provide the
benefits of a dynamic language with the scalability and performance of
Java. Longer term, we hope to enable other programming languages in the
SmartThings Cloud so that you can ultimately chose from several
supported languages. Likely candidates (no promises) for additional
languages include Ruby, JavaScript, Clojure, and Python.

For more documentation on the syntax, structure, and capabilities of
Groovy, visit http://groovy.codehaus.org/Documentation. Note, however,
that because of the application “sandboxing” that we do in the
SmartThings Cloud, some features of Groovy are disabled for security
reasons.
