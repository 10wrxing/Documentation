Event-Handler SmartApps Overview
================================

Event Handler SmartApps are the most common apps developed by our
community. They allow you to connect events from your devices to make
things happen on other devices. We're confident that if you are familiar
with back end development of web sites, then you will be more than
capable of developing SmartApps.

For example, you might walk into the door and the lights turn on.

Solution Module SmartApps Overview
----------------------------------

These apps exist within the dashboard of the SmartThings interfaces, and
are containers for other SmartApps. One example of this would be the
"Home & Family" section of the dashboard which allows you to see the
comings and goings of your family.

Service Manager SmartApps Overview
----------------------------------

Service Manager SmartApps are used to connect to LAN or cloud devices,
such as the Sonos or WeMo. They are the connecting glue between your
external devices with their unique protocols, and a device type handler
you'd create for those devices. They discover devices and then continue
maintain the connection for those devices.

The Service Manager SmartApp must be installed when a user utilizes a
device using LAN or the cloud, so for example, there is a Sonos Service
Manager SmartApp that is installed when pairing with a Sonos.
