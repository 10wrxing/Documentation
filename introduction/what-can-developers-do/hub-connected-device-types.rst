Hub Connected Device Types

ZigBee Device-Types
===================

On the SmartThings platform we support devices connected via the ZigBee
specification. ZigBee is a Personal Area Mesh Networking standard for
connecting and controlling devices. A mesh network transfers information
between devices, allowing it to have an extended range.

ZigBee is an open standard supported by the ZigBee Alliance. For more
information on Zigbee see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZigBee.

Z-Wave Device Type Development Docs
===================================

On the SmartThings platform we support devices connected via the Z-Wave
specification. Z-Wave is a low-power wireless mesh networking protocol
for home automation and lighting control. There are many Z-Wave devices
available on the market, almost all of which are possible to integrate
with SmartThings by building custom device types.

LAN-Connected IP Device-Types
=============================

On the SmartThings platform we support devices connected via a LAN
(Local Area Network). These devices are typically connected to your
network through WiFi. As the SmartHub connects to your network directly
through the ethernet cable, we are able to interact with these devices.
