SmartThings Developer Documentation
===================================

.. note::

    This documentation is a work in progress. Bear with us as we fill in some of the gaps, add clarifications, and expand out the content. It may mean that bookmarks break as we iterate and continually improve our documentation.

    We appreciate your understanding and patience as we work to improve our developer experience!


Welcome to the SmartThings developer documentation. Here you will find information about creating for the SmartThings platform.

This documentation is organized into a few different sections:

:doc:`getting-started`
    Get up and running quickly with the SmartThings platform. Start here if this is your first time developing for SmartThings.

:doc:`introduction/index`
    This chapter discusses some of the core SmartThings concepts, architecture, and how developers can create with SmartThings. It also introduces the SmartThings programming language - Groovy.

:doc:`tools-and-ide/index`
    This guide will teach you how to use the IDE to manage your account, and build and test your custom code.

:doc:`smartapp-developers-guide/index`
    This guide is all about developing SmartApps. It is primarily focused on event-based SmartApps.

:doc:`device-type-developers-guide/index`
    This guide will teach you what a Device Handler is, why they are important, and how to develop one. 

:doc:`cloud-and-lan-connected-device-types-developers-guide/index`
    This guide covers developing with Cloud-connected and LAN devices.

:doc:`smartapp-web-services-developers-guide/index`
    This guide covers creating a SmartApp that exposes its own RESTful endpoints. 

:doc:`arduino/index`
    This guide discusses developing for the Arduino using our SmartThings Shield for Arduino.

:doc:`capabilities-reference`
    This is where you find information on all the supported SmartThings capabilities.

:doc:`ref-docs/reference`
    This is the detailed API documentation for the various SmartThings objects.
