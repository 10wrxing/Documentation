Generating Events in SmartApps
==============================

SmartThings is an “event-driven” system. Status reports from devices are
events. Actions/Commands going to a device are really a special form of
an event. Everything in the SmartThings platform revolves around the
concept of events: generating them, catching and handling them, storing
them, querying for past history of them.

In addition, the platform will soon support the concept of Custom Event
Types. Developers of SmartApps will be able to generate their own custom
events in order to store application-specific information as part of the
event payload, or to communicate from one event handler to another.

**How to generate events**

Events are generated by devices with the SmartThings platform. For
example, you might walk into a space, triggering an event using a motion
sensor. More specifically, an attribute is changed on a device. A
message is sent from the device, which is read via the parse method of
your device type handler. The device type handler then translates the
command and generates a SmartThings event.
