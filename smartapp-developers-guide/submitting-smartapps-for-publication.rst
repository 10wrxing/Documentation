likelihood of success, follow these guidelines:

- Ensure that your submission and it associated content does not contain language or content that offensive, profane, obscene, libelous or otherwise illegal
- Don't include advertising or sponsorships in your SmartApp
- If your SmartApp sends any data from the SmartThings Platform to an external service, include in the description exactly what data is sent to the remote service, how that data will be used, and include a link to the privacy policy of the remote service
- If your SmartApp exposes any Web Service APIs, describe what the APIs will be used for, what data may be accessed by those APIs, and where possible, include a link to the privacy policies of any remote services that may access those APIs.
- Ensure that your SmartApp does not aggressively loop or schedule
- Ensure that your SmartApp does not make aggressive subscriptions
- When requesting access to a user's devices in the SmartApp preferences, avoid the use of device wildcards and use capabilities instead
- Label your SmartApp preferences to match the devices that you are asking for access to
- Use the *password* input type  whenever you are asking a user for a password
