Submitting SmartApps for Publication
====================================

To submit your SmartApps for consideration for publication to the SmartThings Platform, you
can create a Publication Request by clicking on the `My Publication Requests <https://graph.api.smartthings.com/ide/submissions>`__
tab in the `SmartThings IDE <http://ide.smartthings.com>`__, then clicking on the *New Request*
button in the upper-right-hand corner of the screen.

Review Process
--------------

Once submitted, your SmartApp will undergo a review. Here is a detailed outline of the approval process:


Functional Review
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Does this SmartApp duplicate an existing SmartApp? If so, does it improve the current SmartApp?
- Does it have a good title, description, and configuration preferences? Will the user understand how it works?
- Does the SmartApp work as expected?


Code Review
^^^^^^^^^^^

Review and ensure your code follows the :doc:`../code-review-guidelines`.

Publication
^^^^^^^^^^^

Once your app has been approved, it will be published in our mobile app.
