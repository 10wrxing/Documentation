Device Handler Developer's Guide
=============================

Device Handlers (sometimes also referred to as Device Type Handlers, or SmartDevices), are the virtual representation of a physical device. 

If you are new to writing device handlers, start with the :doc:`quick-start`. 

After that, read the :doc:`overview` for a broad discussion about device handlers and where they fit in the SmartThings architecture.

The rest of the guide discusses the various components of device handlers.

.. note::

   This guide discusses hub-connected device handlers. For information about LAN and cloud-connected device handlers, see `this guide <../cloud-and-lan-connected-device-types-developers-guide/index.html>`__
