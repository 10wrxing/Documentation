Getting Help
============

There are a variety of resources available to learn more about SmartThings development, and get help when needed.

Developer Documentation
-----------------------

This developer documentation provides guides and reference material for developing with SmartThings.

The documentation is searchable via the search box on the left of the page. You can also view the documentation in PDF or EPUB format (steps for how).

Community
---------

One of the best things about SmartThings is the amazing `community <https://community.smartthings.com/>`__ of users, makers, and developers. Make sure to register for an account and introduce yourself. It's a great place to learn, help others, and make friends.

If you can't find an answer for your question in the documentation, the community is a great resource as well. You can search for your question in case it has already been addressed, or post a new question.

Open Developer Discussions
--------------------------

Every other Wednesday at 5 PM PST, SmartThings holds an open call for SmartThings developers. The topics vary, but this is an opportunity for you to hear directly from the SmartThings staff, as well as to ask questions.

You'll often get sneak peeks or additional insight not found anywhere else, so we encourage you to stop by.

You can find out more information, including a link to the calendar invite, at http://smartthings.com/developers. We'll also typically provide an agenda for the upcoming developer call on the community site (in the Groups and Events category).
