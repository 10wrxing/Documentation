Getting Help
============

In addition to this documentation, there are other ways to learn and get help developing for SmartThings, discussed below.

Developer Documentation
-----------------------

Use this documentation to learn about SmartThings development, as well as serve as a reference. The documentation is searchable, and can be viewed and downloaded in a variety of formats including PDF and EPUB (click on "Read the Docs" on the bottom left of the page to see the download options).

This documentation is open source and available in GitHub `here <https://github.com/SmartThingsCommunity/Documentation>`__.

----

Community
---------

One of the best things about SmartThings is the amazing `community <https://community.smartthings.com/>`__ of users, makers, and developers. Make sure to register for an account and introduce yourself. It's a great place to learn, help others, and make friends.

If you can't find an answer for your question in the documentation, the community is a great resource as well. You can search for your question in case it has already been addressed, or post a new question.

Many of the SmartThings staff frequents these forums as well. We'll chime in and try to be helpful.

Open Developer Discussions
--------------------------

Every other Wednesday at 5 PM PST, SmartThings holds an open call for SmartThings developers. The topics vary, but this is an opportunity for you to hear directly from the SmartThings staff, as well as to ask questions.

You'll often get sneak peeks or additional insight not found anywhere else, so we encourage you to stop by.

You can find out more information, including a link to the calendar invite, at http://smartthings.com/developers. We'll also typically provide an agenda for the upcoming developer call on the community site (in the Groups and Events category).
