Quick Start
===========

This quick start will get you up and running with SmartThings development. If you've never developed with SmartThings before, start here.

In this tutorial, you will:

- Learn how to create a new SmartThings account.
- Become familiar with the web-based tools for administering your SmartThings.
- Learn about the web Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and simulator.
- Use the IDE and simulator to install and test a simple SmartApp.

Let's get started.

Overview
--------

SmartThings offers a rich toolset to administer their SmartThings account, as well as to develop, test, and publish custom code.

Don't have a SmartThings hub or any devices yet? Carry on! You can still create an account and even develop without any hardware, by using our online IDE and simulator.

Of course, you'll want to have the hardware sooner than later, but you can get started with nothing more than a web browser and an internet connection.

Create an Account
-----------------

If you don't have a SmartThings account, register for one at http://graph.api.smartthings.com.

Log In
------

Using your SmartThings account, `log in <https://graph.api.smartthings.com/login/auth>`__ to the developer site.

The :ref:`tools-ide` guide discusses the developer tools in more detail, but for now, let's look at a few key features to get you comfortable.

<screenshots needed? might help spice up this page a bit too>

Account Management
``````````````````

You can use the tools available to view and manage your Locations, Hubs, and Devices, as well as view a live log of your SmartThings.

IDE and Simulator
`````````````````

At the top of the page, you'll notice links for *My SmartApps* and *My Device Types*. This is where any custom code will be listed. Clicking on any SmartApp or Device Type will bring you to the code editor, where you can view, edit, test, and publish your custom code.

As a new SmartThings developer, you won't have any SmartApps or Device Types yet. We will guide you through creating one in the :ref:`first-smartapp-tutorial`.

Next Steps
----------

Now that you have a SmartThings account and can log into the developer tools, you should complete the :ref:`first-smartapp-tutorial`. This will guide you through creating your first SmartApp, and explain important concepts along the way.
