SmartThings offers a rich toolset to administer their SmartThings account, as well as to develop, test, and publish custom code.

.. tip::

    Don't have a SmartThings hub or any devices yet? Carry on! You can still create an account and even develop without any hardware, by using our online IDE and simulator.

The :ref:`tools-ide` guide discusses the developer tools in more detail, but for now, let's look at a few key features to get you comfortable.

Account Management
``````````````````

You can use the tools available to view and manage your Locations, Hubs, and Devices, as well as view a live log of your SmartThings.

IDE and Simulator
`````````````````

At the top of the page, you'll notice links for *My SmartApps* and *My Device Types*. This is where any custom code will be listed. Clicking on any SmartApp or Device Type will bring you to the code editor, where you can view, edit, test, and publish your custom code.

We'll walk through creating your first SmartApp next. After that, you should feel comfortable using the IDE to create, edit, test, and publish custom SmartThings code.
