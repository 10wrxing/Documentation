Next Steps
==========

Now that you know what the SmartThings developer platform offers, you can dive in to the fun stuff.

If you're new to Groovy, we recommend that you read through the :ref:`learning-groovy` tutorial. You'll learn about Groovy, and how SmartThings uses it for development.

Once you've completed that (or maybe you're the adventurous sort and just want to dive right in to some SmartApp code), check out the :ref:`first-smartapp` tutorial.

In addition to the tutorials and this documentation, there are other ways to learn and get help developing for SmartThings, discussed below.

Community
---------

One of the best things about SmartThings is the amazing `community <https://community.smartthings.com/>`__ of users, makers, and developers. Make sure to register for an account and introduce yourself. It's a great place to learn, help others, and make friends.

If you can't find an answer for your question in the documentation, the community is a great resource as well. You can search for your question in case it has already been addressed, or post a new question.

Many of the SmartThings staff frequents these forums as well. We'll chime in and try to be as helpful (Usually. Sometimes we just cause trouble :)).

Open Developer Discussions
--------------------------

Every other Wednesday at 5 PM PST, SmartThings holds an open call for SmartThings developers. The topics vary, but this is an opportunity for you to hear directly from the SmartThings staff, as well as to ask questions.

You'll often get sneak peeks or additional insight not found anywhere else, so we encourage you to stop by.

You can find out more information, including a link to the calendar invite, at http://smartthings.com/developers. We'll also typically provide an agenda for the upcoming developer call on the community site (in the Groups and Events category).
